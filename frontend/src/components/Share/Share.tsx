The pilot runs through July 3 and the money will be distributed based on number and size of donations made to the participating businesses. All funds raised during this pilot will go to pay for ${selectedBusiness.expenditure_details.reduce(

  )} and if the pilot is successful, it will be used as a template for helping keep downtowns all across America vibrant in spite of COVID-19. \n\nFollow the link in bio to our page where you can learn about our business, make a donation, and find all of the other great participating businesses! \n@downtownboulder @tridentboulder @pieceloveandchocolate @_jlounge_ @kondition_fitness @amanayoga @timewarp_comics \n\n#lovethelocal #downtownboulder #boulder #myboulder #bouldercolorado #pearlstreet #pearlstreetmall #colorado #coloradoliving`;
